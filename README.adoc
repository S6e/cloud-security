= Cloud Native Java EE Showcase

This showcase demonstrates how to build a cloud native application using Java EE and
selected open source components from Netflix OSS. The individual parts will later
be deployed and run using Docker, Kubernetes and DC/OS.

== Build instructions

In order to compile and run the examples you do not need much. A recent JDK8 needs to
be available in your SEU.
```shell
$ ./gradlew clean build
```

== Running the Cloud Native Java EE showcase

=== Locally

The showcase can be run on your local machine as well as using Docker Compose, Minikube
or Minishift.

```
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

=== Google Container Engine

- Install the gcloud SDK for Mac (or Windows)
- Make sure you have a project with billing activated as well as the container engine management API
- Make sure you have `kubectl` installed, either using `gcloud` or using `brew` et.al.

```
$ gcloud config list project
$ gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b
$ gcloud config set container/use_client_certificate False

$ gcloud container clusters create cloud-native-javaee --num-nodes=5 --enable-autoscaling --min-nodes=5 --max-nodes=7

$ gcloud container clusters describe cloud-native-javaee

$ gcloud auth application-default login
$ kubectl cluster-info
```

Once you are done, remember to delete the cluster again!
```
$ gcloud container clusters delete cloud-native-javaee
```
